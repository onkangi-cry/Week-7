# Week-7
This project explores the ethical, technical, and social aspects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) through theoretical understanding, real-world case studies, practical dataset audits, and reflective analysis. It is structured into four main parts along with a bonus policy drafting section.

Part 1 covers theoretical questions and principles. It defines algorithmic bias with examples, explains the differences between transparency and explainability, and outlines how GDPR affects AI development in the European Union. It also includes an ethical principles matching activity that connects common values to their practical definitions.

Part 2 provides in-depth case studies on two real-world AI ethics failures: Amazonâ€™s biased hiring tool and facial recognition used in policing. Each scenario includes identification of the problem, proposed solutions, and evaluation methods to ensure fairness and ethical deployment.

Part 3 is a practical dataset audit using IBM's AI Fairness 360 toolkit. The COMPAS Recidivism dataset is analyzed for racial bias, specifically focusing on false positive rate disparities between African-American and Caucasian defendants. A Python-based analysis is performed, and a written report summarizes the findings, causes of bias, and recommended remediation techniques.

Part 4 offers a personal reflection on how ethical principles are embedded in a real AI project called Pure Flow. This project focuses on pollution monitoring using AI and IoT and applies principles like fairness, transparency, and informed consent.

The Bonus Task includes a one-page policy proposal for ethical AI in healthcare. It addresses key areas such as patient consent, bias mitigation, transparency requirements, and institutional accountability mechanisms.

The complete assignment integrates ethical theory with hands-on auditing tools and practical applications. It is intended for anyone interested in building responsible AI systems that align with human rights and societal values.
